    LayerBreaker is a collaboration born out of community.<br>
    62 artists were involved from over 20 countries. None of whom ever met in person, yet this is one of the largest collaboration to date.<br>
    The idea being what can we do with a global economy and technology which enables trustless relationships.<br>
    There are 61 layers, 284 states for this project.<br>

  <!-- intro -->
  <!-- h2>A word from MightyMouse</h2>
  <section class="gallery">
    This project was sparked by a desire to see what could happen if a truly open call to artists was made. I wanted to see what could happen if we opened this up to everyone regardless of their experience in the space.
    <br><br>
    Async reached out to me after a tweet I did in Feb and after some brief discussions they signed on and we were off.
    The idea was to gather as many artists together from as many places as possible. But I had seen other large collabs happen where they just felt like a bunch  of art slapped together with limited cohesiveness. I wanted an idea which would allow for artist freedom but would give the master a feel that they belonged on the same canvas. 
    <br><br>
    So I came up with the idea of a gradient which was tiles. 60 tiles for 60 artists. Each tile would have a HEX code assigned and then that tile would be assigned to an artist. From there the artist could be given total visual freedom to express themselves and yet the gradient colors could create a cohesive feel and look.
    So I reached out to color expert @jeffgdavis#0102 to see if he was willing to build the gradient for me.
    He was great and helpful, built the gradient and then I set out to open up sign ups
    <br><br>
    That was interesting as I wanted to make sure everyone had the best opportunity to gain access so picking a time to launch the sign up where someone in Australia, Japan, Russia, South America,  the UK and the states all were awake made it difficult but I picked a time that was 11pm one place and 5am another and everything in between.
    That was my first hint that this was not gonna be a simple collab ðŸ˜† 
    <br><br>
    Anyway, sign ups were filled within a half hour and we began the journey to explain the vision to all the artists. Along the way we had many bumps in the road but through the dedication of each of the artists and Async we have arrived here. Some don't really understand what Async did to make this happen as Conlan and the team literally built new minting technology in order for the artists to sign their work with their own wallets. This is paramount in my mind and a VERY unique aspect to this collab. 
    <br><br>
    I believe every artist should sign their work with their wallet as it gives clear and easy provenance to the collector. To my knowledge this is one of the biggest collabs where the artists have all signed their work in this way.
    This brings a very unique and long lasting value to this project aside from the incredible visual art made by all involved.
    <br><br>
    Layer Breaker is such a huge collaboration of epic proportions. It's a testament to what a community can achieve when they team up together, and not go against each other.  We hope to share the spirit and ethos as Async goes forward too!

    layerbreaker op website zetten: trailer + Async article + insp https://medium.com/@ryanhaigh/layerbreaker-52-6daf573c8b + Deze intro https://rubenalexander.medium.com/62-artist-collaboration-layerbreaker-on-asyncart-227cac308e0b en https://www.wha.digital/layer_breaker
Because the state changes are recorded on the blockchain (because Async is awesome) the history of this pieces formation and creative expression will be traceable from this point forward.

  <!--h2>My Layer</h2-->
  <!-- section>
    My layer gives the collector the choice beweent 4 semi abstract portraits. These portraits represent emotions and feelings. Instead of specific emotions I tried to use abstract emotions that could be interpreted differently by everyone and at every moment. This way I hope every feeling can be linked to one the 4 portraits. Every day one could wake up and link how he/she is feeling to one of my4 states. The purple skinned girl for example could represent proudness, courage, elegance,Â â€¦. I hope other things then just emotions will be linked to these portraits as wel. Maybe on the birthday of your father the beard one speaks to you?
I tried to fit in my tile by blending the colours of the surrounding tiles into my background. The left, right, top and bottom have the colour of the neighbouring tile slowly flowing to the colour that was given to my tile.
While the backgrounds fit in nicely, the drawings needed to stand out! To make an impact on the master artwork from within just a small tile I knew I needed bold, black and white drawings.
This is my first non-commissioned NFT, so the fact that someone was willing to pay 0.5 ETH for it really means a lot to me!
